categories: [IoT data services]
excerpt: The Managed IoT Data Services is an architectural design (solution) pattern. It has three models that can be used by IT departments of enterprises that deliver IoT services to their Operation Technology (OT) teams, or by an IoT service provider as three models to deliver value to their customers. This pattern focuses on the data collection and data consumption parts of an IoT platform or solution and not the device management aspect.
