categories: [Apps,Infra]
excerpt: What do you need to do if you would like to use a different design?

The standard design you get out of the box when creating a Blazor application is based on Bootstrap. It doesn't matter whether you go for a server side or a web assembly implementation. But what do you need to do if you would like to use a different design? Say, for example, dress up your app in the Microsoft Office 365 look. This post shows you your options to achieve exactly that. If you are not yet familiar with Blazor and/or Fluent Design, you're in luck, because I'll start with a (brief) explanation of both first. This gives us the foundation to build upon.
